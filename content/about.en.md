This site's goal is to give learners awesome tools to help them learning languages. For now it focuses on the Russian language. and the main topic is russian verbs as I find them hard to master I thought that pragmatic tools such as webpages and reference guides were needed.


If you are interested to produce or distribute tools and documentation related to learning languages you are very welcome, please send me an email.



### About me

I'm Vincent Charrade, french guy, learning the russian language during my free time. I have traveled a few times in Russia to take intensive russian language courses, work as a volunteer in farms and to russian festivals.


Thanks for reading!
