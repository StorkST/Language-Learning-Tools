Hello,

After a short introduction to vocabulary aquisition using words frequency, I will bring in a tool to work on russian verbs.

#### Vocabulary acquisition
Vocabulary acquisition of a foreign language vocabulary can be active (e.g. learning a list of new words) or incidental through context (e.g. through speach, reading, movies). Each approach has its limitations and obviously they should be used in a complementary way.

Concerning the benefit of active learning of vocabulary, here is a quote from [2013, Corpus-based vocabulary lists for language learners for nine languages](http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/serge/publications/2014-LREV-kelly.pdf):

> There are a number of studies that have indicated the usefulness of lists in word-learning, such as Schmitt and Schmitt 1995; Waring 2004; and Mondria and Mondria-de Vries 1994; as well as Hulstijn 2001 and Nation 2001, who found that the use of word lists seems to exhibit good retention and faster gains. In fact, “there are a very large number of studies showing the effectiveness of such learning (i.e. using vocabulary cards) in terms of the amount and speed of learning” (Nation 1997).



This study then focus on the usefulness of a list built from a representative corpus of the target language where the most frequent words would be extracted. The most frequent words being the most useful for the learner of a foreign language. That is to say in a more pragmatic way that a learner knowing the full taxonomy of birds won't help him get a taxi to the airport, but knowing the most frequent verbs of motion will be a great help.


#### Russian verbs acquisition

Now let's focus on the russian language.

Mastering verbs of the russian language is not only highly relevant as verbs are cross-contexts, but also because from verbs are built nouns and adjectives.
Once mastered, verbs opens up the horizon of new contexts (e.g. for verbs of motion ездить, лететь: moving in and between cities, taking a plane, going to Mars) and new vocabulary (e.g. поездка, проезд, приезд, полёт, летающий...) built from these verbs.

In 2013 was defined a list of the top 9000 most frequent russian words.
The list of words, with words metedata, can be found [here](http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/serge/kelly/). The study about how the list is built can be found here: [Serge Sharoff, Elena Umanskaya, James Wilson, 2013, Frequency Dictionary of Contemporary Russian Core Vocabulary for Learner](http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/serge/publications/2013-routledge-intro.pdf).


From this list of words were extracted all of the verbs (around 1700) in order to build a ressource to help learners of the russian language.


# Table of the most frequent russian verbs

The table of the most frequent words comes as a [Webpage](https://storkst.github.io/CoreRussianVerbs/) where the verbs are ordered by decreasing frequency, that is to say by level of mastering of the language (from beginner A1 to advanced C2). Verbs can be filtered and columns can be shown or hidden.

Also at the bottom of the Webpage are daily verbs, picked from the list!

The table is also available as a .csv file that might be frequently updated. It can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StorkST/CoreRussianVerbs/master/RussianVerbsClassification.csv)

A more detailed presentation of the tool can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/StorkST/CoreRussianVerbs)


#### How to use it?

That table (Webpage and .csv file) has many usage cases:
- 
For building cards, for the daily verbs, for learning by level rank


#### What is next

Need help to build a sheet of verbs (vocabulary cards of verbs). Here is a link to the pdf:
