Hello,

After a short introduction to vocabulary aquisition using words frequency, I will bring in a tool to work on russian verbs.

#### Vocabulary acquisition
Vocabulary learning of a foreign language vocabulary can be active (e.g. learning a list of new words) or incidental through context (e.g. through speach, reading, movies). Each approach has its limitations and obviously they should be used in a complementary way.

Concerning the benefit of active learning of vocabulary, here is a quote from [2013, Corpus-based vocabulary lists for language learners for nine languages](http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/serge/publications/2014-LREV-kelly.pdf):

> There are a number of studies that have indicated the usefulness of lists in word-learning, such as Schmitt and Schmitt 1995; Waring 2004; and Mondria and Mondria-de Vries 1994; as well as Hulstijn 2001 and Nation 2001, who found that the use of word lists seems to exhibit good retention and faster gains. In fact, “there are a very large number of studies showing the effectiveness of such learning (i.e. using vocabulary cards) in terms of the amount and speed of learning” (Nation 1997).



This study then focus on the usefulness of a list built from a representative corpus of the target language where the most frequent words would be extracted. The most frequent words being the most useful for the learner of a foreign language. That is to say in a more pragmatic way that for a learner knowing the full taxonomy of birds won't help him to get a taxi to the airport, but knowing the most frequent verbs of movement will be a great help.

How to use it? For building cards, for the daily verbs, for learning by level rank

#### What is next

Need help to build a sheet of verbs (vocabulary cards of verbs). Here is a link to the pdf:
