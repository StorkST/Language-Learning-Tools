Hello,

Do you remember that big colorful table of elements hanging on the wall of the chemistry lab?


This table of elements (Mendeleev's table) comes here in multiple languages.


Beside showing elements of which we should be more aware to have a conversation about topics such as energy management/global warming/environnement, it is a simple tool to get some vocabulary in.
Especially useful if you study or work in a scientific field in a multicultural context.



Adding new languages is pretty easy, let me know if you want to initiate support for a new language.
